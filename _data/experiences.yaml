  description: "Developed a framework from the ground-up which identified structural system with a non-contact measurement method based on a novel Siamese tracker, 
  digital video stabilization, and power spectrum density analyses. The framework only requires consumer-graded cameras, 
  i.e., cellphones' and drones' cameras, and is verified through a shaking table test of a full scale low-damage concrete wall building. 
  The proposed framework was published in a top-tier journal, and is widely used by multiple cities for structural health monitoring in China."
